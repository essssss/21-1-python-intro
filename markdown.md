# Python Notes

I am trying to learn how to use markdown  
I think I will do this while I write my notes on PYTHON

**bold text**

### This is a smaller Header

## slightly bigger

_italics are just **one** star_

> The blockquote goes like this.

> > and then we nest them

> hello

1. AND
2. Here's
3. a
4. list
   1. it is
   2. ordered
5. and with nested elements

- and hyphens
- are how we do
- bullet lists
  - and we can indent these
  - as well  
    and just a regular paragraph gets slotted in, just like this one that I am writing here and now. Hooray! Yay!

```javascript
console.log("we use three backticks to do codefences");
```

and we put the language next to the backticks

# HORIZONTAL RULE

Ok, this was actually markdown notes. I'll make a new one for python. lol
